Reflections Q1: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A: I feel like it is almost always better to use a remote one.  It is not susceptible to system crashes, it allows
other people to work on the project if you choose, it works on different machines if you have multiple machines or
if you change computers.  It has many advantages.

Reflections Q2: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A: Because you might not want the latest changes yet.  Also, somebody may have checked something in that caused problems.  If it was a multi-user project, files are getting checked in all the time and downloading them all immediately may cause instability.

Reflections Q3: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A: Forks make a copy of a git repository on Github and place it in your github account.  Clones make a copy of a repository on your local repository whether it comes from Github or your own local repository.  Branches make a different branch of the code on your local repository so you can make changes without changing the original branch.  You can later merge them.  Use forks when you want a copy on Github, clone when you want to get it to your computer, and branch when you want to explore different ideas.

Reflections Q4: What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

A: So your system can tell you what changed from the last time you synched with the remote repository.

Reflections Q5: How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

A: Collaboration without Git or github would require either painful manual methods like e-mail or dropbox or another version control system.  Almost everything would be harder.
