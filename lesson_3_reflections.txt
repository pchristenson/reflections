Reflections Q1: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A: I feel like it is almost always better to use a remote one.  It is not susceptible to system crashes, it allows
other people to work on the project if you choose, it works on different machines if you have multiple machines or
if you change computers.  It has many advantages.
