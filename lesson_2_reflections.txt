Reflections Q1: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need
to do it?

A: Git initializes the repository.  Basically, it creates a hidden file that
tracks all the meta data about the files in the directory and their changes.
You need to do it to tell Git to start tracking this directory.

Reflections Q2: How is the staging area different from the working directory and
the repository? What value do you think it offers?

A: It acts as an intermediary between the two.  It allows things to be staged
together and then added as a group.
